# Database usage

## Database migrations

Database migrations are handled using [`knex.js`](https://knexjs.org/) and can be migrated manually using the following commands:

```sh
npx knex migrate:latest # used to migrate to latest database version
npx knex migrate:up # used to migrate to the next database version
npx knex migrate:down # used to migrate to the previous database version
```

## Table structure

The following tables exist in the `veritable` database.

### `members`

`members` represent the on-chain member identities, and provides storage for aliases to be stored when optionally selected to do so.

#### Columns

| column       | PostgreSQL type           | nullable |       default        | description                        |
| :----------- | :------------------------ | :------- | :------------------: | :--------------------------------- |
| `id`         | `UUID`                    | FALSE    | `uuid_generate_v4()` | Unique identifier for the `member` |
| `address`    | `CHARACTER VARYING (50)`  | FALSE    |          -           | The address of the member          |
| `alias`      | `CHARACTER VARYING (50)`  | FALSE    |          -           | A friendly name for the member     |
| `created_at` | `Timestamp with timezone` | FALSE    |       `now()`        | When the row was first created     |
| `updated_at` | `Timestamp with timezone` | FALSE    |       `now()`        | When the row was last updated      |

#### Indexes

| columns   | Index Type | description                                                                    |

| `address` | Unique     | Prevents more than one `member` from being created with an identical `address` |
| `alias`   | Unique     | Prevents more than one `member` from being created with an identical `alias`   |
